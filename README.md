# MYP-Project-Game
A game I made in Grade 10 for my high school passion project.
I spent 5 months creating a videogame and documenting the process for my IB Middle Years Program personal project.  My Reflective Essay placed first in my school.
This game was heavily influenced from the Brackey's 2d Game Development series on YouTube.
